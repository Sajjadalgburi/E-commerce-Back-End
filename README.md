## Description

In this week's assignment, I was given a head start with the codebase for an E-commerce Back End application. Essentially, my task was to flesh out the remaining logic, including defining the Sequelize models, initializing the server, and implementing RESTful routes, among other things. Surprisingly, this turned out to be one of the easier projects I've tackled, largely because I diligently prepared in the previous week. However, I encountered challenges, particularly in understanding the various Sequelize associations that needed implementation. Despite this, I found the project enjoyable because it allowed me to delve into handling different CRUD operations to cater to diverse user requests!
